  <h1><b>About Spotify</b></h1>
  <p>
    Spotify’s platform revolutionized music listening forever when we launched
    in 2008. Our move into podcasting brought innovation and a new generation of
    listeners to the medium, and in 2022 we entered the next audio market primed
    for growth with the addition of audiobooks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, more listeners than ever can discover, manage and enjoy over 100
    million tracks, 5 million podcast titles, and 350,000 audiobooks on Spotify.
    We are the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service with
    more than 551 million users, including 220 million subscribers in more than
    180 markets.
